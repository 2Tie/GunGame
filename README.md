# Gun Game
Use ReachVariantTool to compile the .lua into the .bin, as well as to make non-scripting changes to the mode.

The gist of this mode is to get kills with all weapons in the Reach sandbox, barring the Target Locator (due to problems with indoor maps). Once you hit the final tier, the 7 wood, eight more kills are needed to win (ending at 30 points). At 25 points and higher, a player will always be marked by waypoint. How special interactions such as grenade sticks or assassinations are resolved is user configurable ingame. 

General weapon order goes from easiest to get kills with to hardest, which currently stands as:
* Rockets
* FRG
* Sniper
* Needle Rifle
* DMR
* Concussion Rifle
* Machine Turret
* Plasma Turret
* Focus Rifle
* Grenade Launcher
* Needler
* Sword
* Hammer
* Shotgun
* Magnum
* Splazer
* Plasma Launcher
* Plasma Rifle
* Assault Rifle
* Spiker
* Plasma Repeater
* Plasma Pistol
* 7 Wood (with lowered damage resistance)  

An order of easy -> hard was chosen to enable most players to be able to make good progress through the tiers, even when joining late (in the case of a custom game browser lobby) as well as to balance out skilled players who may have jumped ahead in tiers quicker. Reverse weapon order is implemented also, but currently disabled pending bugfixes.

Mode originally created by gamertag TrustySnooze.
